## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

It has been 50 years since Tolkien's death. His works have entered the public domain in many countries and regions. With the idea of sharing and hoping that more people can enter the world of Middle-earth, a series of repositories has been created to share Tolkien's works.

Please remember that, no all countries and regions take the life-plus-50-year Berne Convention.
