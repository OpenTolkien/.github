## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It has been 50 years since Tolkien's passing, and in many countries and regions, his works have now entered the public domain. With the spirit of sharing and the hope that more people can enter the world of Middle-earth, a series of repositories has been created to make Tolkien's works more accessible.

However, please note that not all countries and regions follow the life-plus-50-year term of the Berne Convention.
